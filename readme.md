This is a project is used to review some basic applications of logistic classifier methods in machine learning.
Firstly, I read a data file into my python notebook, and then I use logistic algorithms to predict how the machine will review those toys or products in the data set(positive rating or negative rating).

Noticeï¼š the project assignment is from the Coursera class (machine learning) which was conducted by University of Washington (Seattle).
